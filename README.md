Based on the book, [Python Crash Course](http://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/)

The programming language itself (Required):

There are many Python IDE or text editors to choose from, ultimately, which to use is subjective, so choose the one that suits you.

Personally, I prefer Geany for Python. You can also download their plugins which support a wide range of functions that you may find useful.
